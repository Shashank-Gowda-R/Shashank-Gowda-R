# Hello, I'm Shashank Gowda R ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in Ruby on Rails, Odoo (Sales, Purchase, PoS, Inventory, Barcode), Python, and AWS (EC2, RDS, ECR, CloudWatch). I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at Koskii, where I focus on building scalable and efficient solutions.

## Summary
âš¡ Breaking Code, âš¡ Building Solutions

Ever wondered how technology can transform the way businesses operate? I do. Every. Single. Day.

They say a developer writes code. I say a developer builds solutions. From automating business workflows to scaling web applications and deploying cloud solutions, I donâ€™t just develop softwareâ€”I create systems that work smarter, faster, and better.

### The Problem-Solverâ€™s Mindset
For me, technology is more than just syntax and logicâ€”itâ€™s about solving real-world problems that drive efficiency, scalability, and innovation. Whether itâ€™s:
- Optimizing complex systems to enhance performance and reliability
- Architecting scalable applications that handle high traffic and data loads
- Leveraging cloud technologies to build flexible and secure infrastructures
- Automating workflows to eliminate repetitive tasks and improve productivity

I thrive on challenges that push boundaries, drive innovation, and create impact.

### From Passion to Proficiency
With 1+ year of hands-on experience in software development, I focus on:
- Building & optimizing scalable systems across various domains
- Architecting robust backend solutions with modern frameworks & technologies
- Developing high-performance APIs & cloud-powered applications

### Beyond Just Code
Technology evolves fast, and I never stop learning. I have an insatiable curiosity to explore new technologies and implement them in meaningful ways. Whether itâ€™s cloud computing, AI-driven automation, or a new backend frameworkâ€”Iâ€™m always experimenting.

If you love pushing boundaries, solving problems, and building the future, letâ€™s connect! âš¡
